Compile using make
irrKlang may need some adjusting to compile, mp3 is supported, but will be dealt with after a usable UI is created.

Currently only Linux is supported.


TODO:
Add UI using ncurses library.
Player class (ability to play and pause)
Link UI with model.
Make cross platform (file reader is not, but can easily be made to be).
